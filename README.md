This is an Android Based App that has FireBase Integration.
I made this App In an attempt to learn Android and Android Studio.

Functionalities of this App:

1. Login And Register yourself as a new User.

2. Add Daily tasks And items which you spent on and there's a section to add a little note besides it if in case you want to add note it where you bought it from or spent on what?

Things Learnt:
1. Android Studio
2. FireBase Integration
3. How to Add Different Types of Views (Like Linear RecyclerView etc).
